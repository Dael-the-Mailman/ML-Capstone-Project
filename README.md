## About the Competition
Given the data provided by American Express predict whether or not a customer will default on their credit card. Applications for this technology are risk management and creating the infrastructure for large scale data analytics.

## About the Application
==TODO==

### Format of the data
The features of the dataset are split up into 5 groups
- D_* = Delinquency variables
- S_* = Spend variables
- P_* = Payment variables
- B_* = Balance variables
- R_* = Risk variables

The following features are categorical while the rest are normalized continuous data:

` ['B_30', 'B_38', 'D_114', 'D_116', 'D_117', 'D_120', 'D_126', 'D_63', 'D_64', 'D_66', 'D_68'] `

### Data Used During Development
I utilized the [AMEX Integer Parquet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/amex-data-integer-dtypes-parquet-format) by Raddar. This dataset reduces the size of the original dataset considerably. Not only does this make training much faster but it saves on space as well. Performance was also increased as when I tested an XGBoost model on the original dataset the model performed about 30% worse.

## Insights from the data
Gave up EDA in favor of looking at other people's EDA. ðŸ™‚

## Models Tested
#### Model 1: XGBoost Kaggle Starter
> Score: 0.793

I followed the [XGBoost Kaggle Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/xgboost-starter-0-793) by Chris Deotte as my first submission. I used this as a way to get a first submission in fast. I will use the general structure of the notebook as the basis for future models.

#### Model 2:

## Feature Engineering

#### Featuretools

#### Autofeat

#### Tsfresh

#### Stumpy

#### Custom Feature Engineering
